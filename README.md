# Avci-Topaloglu-Paper-Heuristic-for-Comparing-with-Table-3

There are 6 Heuristic Files namely:- ATS_Algorithm.py , ATS_Flowchart.py , ATS_Text.py , HLS_Algorithm.py , HLS_Flowchart.py and HLS_Text.py
The PuLP Algorithm is also present here, but may be considered redundant as the number of Vehicles are not Limited for any Vehicle Type in case of the Heuristics.

The GeneRead.py File reads as well as generates the Distance Matrix, Node Locations and Vehicle Type files in the respective folders.

The MainPythonFile.py calls the other files and generates all solutions within a Solutions directory when it is run.

The Solutions directory is also attached. The Total RunTime of obtaining the Solutions Directory was 4 full days (about 90 hours).
